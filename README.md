# python-serial-device-link-path-to-device

Sometimes needing to know the path of a specific serial device in linux is necessary to reduce 
overhead in calling all possible devices connected to the computer. This code uses JSON to send 
messages between python and the serial device and it tags the identity of the serial device to the path 
of the device in linux in a dictionary.

Hope this helps :)
